## Data Science Applications with Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository showcases the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various data science applications. Here, we explore how LLMs can be leveraged for tasks like:

* **Embeeddings:** Understanding embeddings and creating an embedded dataset.
* **Clustering:** Using Kmeans++ to cluster data.
* **Semantic Search:** Implementing a simple semantic search.
* **Data Classification:** Classifying data in a simple way.

This project provides a starting point for exploring the intersection of data science and LLMs. We offer a combination of:

* **Code examples:**  Demonstrate practical implementations of LLM functionalities for data science tasks using libraries like [pandas, langchain, sklearn].
* **Case studies:** Showcase applications of LLMs in various data science domains.
* **Discussion:** Explore the challenges, limitations, and other considerations of using LLMs in data science.
